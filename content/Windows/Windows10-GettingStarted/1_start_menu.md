# The Start Menu

One of the major changes in Windows 10 is the start menu. A lot of people missed the good old start menu in Windows 8, and in windows 10 it's back... With quite a bit of Windows 8's essence added in.

### Layout

The start menu consists of 3 sections: On the top left you have your apps, On the right are the "Tiles" and on the bottom left you have the tools section. Whilst this may change in later updates of Windows 10 (e.g. After the Creator's Update), the same basic layout applies.

### Search

Windows 10 includes a "Personal Assistant" called Cortana. This is much like Siri, Alexa or the Google Assistant in it's ability to help you with day-to-day tasks like creating calendar events, sending emails or just finding things on your PC. Cortana is heavily integrated into Windows 10 and replaces the good old helper dog from Windows XP by helping you search your PC for any files or applications you may need. 

### Tiles

Back in Windows 8, Microsoft introduced the Metro UI. This consisted of a touch friendly set of applications, all accessible through a tiled interface like on Windows Phones. This is still present in Windows 10 but is now part of the start menu in a hybrid fo Windows 7 and 8's styles. These tiles can be used as simple click-to-open shortcuts for various apps, or can be used for more interactive applications as **Live Tiles**.

### Multiple Desktops

This is a neat feature that hasn't been in any other versions of Windows before... Have you ever been at the point where you just have way too much stuff open at once and you just cant find your way around? Filing through 28 windows to find that one that you opened the other day with a specific Document in... It's a nightmare!

Luckily, with the multi-desktop feature you can now separate out sets of windows into multiple "Virtual desktops" Effectively, This is like having extra screens for you to use. You could use one desktop as your personal space, then when you're at work, Just switch to the work desktop. There's all your work, exactly as you left it!
